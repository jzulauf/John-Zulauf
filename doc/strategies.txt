Prefetch:
	Note: you can't prefetch the 0th
	requires unrolling
	ONLY three prefetch slots
		implies two cachline unrolls (max)
		(address math is thus shift math, isn't for 3 line)
	need to minimize cache impact for small copies

Dword-align
	Either src or dst
	Several different approaches c.f. i686/memset and i586/strcpy
		i686 -- xor/and filter
		i586 -- hardcoded jump target (computed based on stanza)
			need to objdump this -- seems "too clever"

Use of Dword-ops
	extant in much of sysdep/i386
	rep instruction take M + Nc where
		M is fixed startup cost and
		N is cycles per count
		c is count (number of iterations)
		dword means c >> 2 vs. bytes
	need to compare vs. repne; scasb kinds of ops.
		strlen, strcpy, et. al. must check for '\0'
		dword algorithms are more complex per/dword

Open Questions:
	cost of conditional jumps (Dan Yee for the jmp questions)
	optimal scheduling for flag-setting ops vs. conditional jmp
	branch prediction
		how to avoid it slowing us down.
