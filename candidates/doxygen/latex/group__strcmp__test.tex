\section{Strcmp performance test}
\label{group__strcmp__test}\index{Strcmp performance test@{Strcmp performance test}}
The performance and optimzation test for strcmp. Uses the framework provided by {\bf \char`\"{}test\_\-\char`\"{} Test framework for performance testing} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{group__test})} and {\bf \char`\"{}loop\_\-\char`\"{} Standard loops for testing and reporting} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{group__loop__test})}. 
Status

The testing and optimization has be completed

Notes Reference is made to the 'Darwin \char`\"{}magic\char`\"{} algorithm.' By this we are referring to the dword zero find algorithm which uses the 0xfefefeff \char`\"{}magic\char`\"{} number. This is similar to (and mathematically equivalent to) the i486 implementation but is implemented in fewer instructions and fewer conditional jumps.

Note also that as the Darwin code was PPC assembly, thus only the algorithm and not the implementation is reflected in the implementation here.

The performance of the unrolled i686, while slightly better than lx\-Dw's {\tt repe} approach, is suggestive of approaches to take for other optimizations.
